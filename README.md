## 📖 Overview

The Student Performance Prediction System is a web application that uses machine learning to forecast student academic outcomes based on factors like study habits, demographic information, school resources, and social activities. This tool helps educators identify at-risk students early and implement targeted interventions.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: User-friendly interface for inputting student data
- **Performance Prediction**: Predicts final grades and identifies at-risk students
- **Factor Analysis**: Shows which factors most significantly impact performance
- **Visual Analytics**: Interactive charts and graphs for data visualization
- **Multi-output Prediction**: Predicts performance across multiple subjects
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5, Chart.js
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Database**: SQLite (for demo), PostgreSQL (for production)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-prediction.git
cd student-performance-prediction
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Initialize the database:
```bash
python init_db.py
```

5. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the Student Performance Dataset which includes information about:
- Demographic factors (age, gender, family size)
- Social and educational background (parent's education, occupation)
- Study habits (study time, extra educational support)
- School-related factors (school, class failures, extracurricular activities)
- Academic performance (grades in various subjects)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The project uses an **Ensemble Learning approach** with Gradient Boosting and Random Forest classifiers:

- Overall Accuracy: 91%
- Precision: 89%
- Recall: 93%
- F1-Score: 91%

### Model Training Process:
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Feature engineering and selection
3. Handling categorical variables
4. Addressing class imbalance using SMOTE
5. Model training with cross-validation
6. Hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimization

## 🚀 Usage

1. Navigate to the application homepage
2. Fill in the student details in the input form
3. Click the "Predict Performance" button
4. View the predicted performance across different subjects
5. Examine the key factors influencing the prediction
6. Access the analytics dashboard for historical data trends
